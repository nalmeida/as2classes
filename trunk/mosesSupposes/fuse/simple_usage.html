	ABOUT
	Don't freak!
	
	The mass of code below is a vey simple tutorial that you can do step by step. :)
	
	There's a movieclip on stage with the name box1_mc (named using the properties inspector palette).
	
	Here you'll see a bunch of examples of tweens that are triggered right on the movieclip itself using
	tweening shortcut commands.
	
	All the shortcuts accept around the same parameters - walk through each example below to learn them.
	
	
	HOW TO USE
	Uncomment any line of code below, by temporarily removing the "//" in front of it, which will make it run.
	Some tips if this is new to you:
		- Replace the "//" before you uncomment the next one, or if the commands don't conflict you should 
			try letting a few run at once.
		- To make it easy just place your cursor after the // and hit return, then later hit backspace.
	
*/

/* 1. Shortcuts will run with a default of 1 second and "easeOutQuint" easing if you only pass the basics.
	Try out each of these lines with Test Movie. */

/* bezierTo accepts x, y, controlX, controlY */
//this.box1_mc.bezierTo(400,100,300,200);

/* fadeIn and fadeOut do an alpha fade and set _visible false when out. */
//this.box1_mc.fadeOut();

//this.box1_mc.fadeIn();

/* frameTo tweens the timeline playhead itself, here making this timeline go to 40. */
//this.frameTo(40, 1);

/* You probably won't use this one, but it affects a flash7-type color transform. */
//this.box1_mc.colorTransformTo(0,100,100,50,100,50,50,0);

/* The granddaddy of them all is "tween", which lets you pass any parameter, including some
	added by the engine that you may not have seen yet. (You will in the other files here.)
	(This only scratches the surface since you can also tween more than one property at once.) */
//this.box1_mc.tween('_xscale', 4000);


/* okay, comment out all the examples above and let's move on. ---------------------------------------
	 2. "Know your relatives"
 		ZigoEngine has a trick for setting relative values, simply use quotes.
		
		Try the different examples below, first one then the other to see the difference.
		Relative values (numbers in quotes) are calculated from the existing settings.
*/

//this.box1_mc.slideTo(100,100); // goes to these exact coords on the stage from upper left.
//this.box1_mc.slideTo('100','100'); // moves 100 each direction from where it is.

//this.box1_mc.slideTo(-10, -10); // goes to these exact coords on the stage from upper left.
//this.box1_mc.slideTo('-10','-10'); // moves 100 each direction from where it is.

//this.box1_mc.bezierTo(150,50,100, 250);
//this.box1_mc.bezierTo('100','0','0','-50');

//this.box1_mc.scaleTo(300);
//this.box1_mc.scaleTo('300');

//this.box1_mc.sizeTo(100);
//this.box1_mc.sizeTo('100');



/* moving on. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	3. Tweens have a bunch more parameters that you can add, with commas of course.
	
	Here they are:
	- one or more destination parameters, depending on the shortcut
	- number of seconds to tween
	- easing style -- "easeOutElastic", "easeInOutExpo", or "easeInBack" etc. --
	- delay before start
	- a function to trigger when the tween is done, also called a "callback".
	
	Uncomment one example at a time below to see each parameter added.
*/

/* Start with a basic slideTo, using relative postioning */
//this.box1_mc.slideTo('300', '0');

/* Now add a duration of 2 seconds - which was previously defaulting to 1 second. */
//this.box1_mc.slideTo('300', '0', 2);

/* Next add an easing type using a PennerEasing shortcut string. */
//this.box1_mc.slideTo('300', '0', 2, 'easeOutElastic');

/* Make the tween start after a 1.5-second delay. */
//this.box1_mc.slideTo('300', '0', 2, 'easeOutElastic', 1.5);

/* Finally, add a trace command that will send a message to the output window.
	(This is just one very simple way you can fire a callback, see other files for more examples.) */
//this.box1_mc.slideTo('300', '0', 2, 'easeOutElastic', 1.5, "trace('Done tweening!')");



/* So, using what you've learned above you can now modify the first set of examples by
	adding duration, easing types, delays, and callbacks. 
	
	A little more about easing: Notice in the setup lines at the very top of this page,
	that PennerEasing is passed to the engine. This registers the shortcut strings you see below.
	
	However, if you have used and prefer the built-in mx easing classes instaead, you may 
	remove PennerEasing from that setup line, add the line import mx.transitions.easing.*; and
	then simply pass an easing function for that parameter, such as Strong.easeOut (no quotes of course).
	
	If you want to stick to the Zigo shortcuts, you'll find a full list of them below.
	(Personally I prefer them simply because there are more to choose from!)
	They're all by the same guy, Robert Penner - his book is highly recommended reading.
	
	Have fun with these!
